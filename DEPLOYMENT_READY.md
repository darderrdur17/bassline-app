## Testing Instructions

### Mobile App (Currently Running)
The app is already running on the iOS Simulator. To test:

1. Navigate to any of the 39 venues listed above
2. Verify the hero image displays correctly
3. Scroll down to see gallery images
4. Check that all venue details display properly

### Website
To test the website:
```bash
cd bassline-web
npm run dev
```
Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Next Steps

1. **Test all 39 venues** to ensure images load correctly
2. **Add remaining venue images** for venues without photos yet
3. **Optimize images** if needed for better performance
4. **Deploy to production** when ready

---

## Technical Notes

- All images use consistent naming: `[venue-name]-hero.jpg` and `[venue-name]-1.jpg`, etc.
- Mobile app uses `require()` for proper bundling
- Website uses public paths like `/images/venues/[image-name].jpg`
- VenueCard component now safely handles missing optional fields
- Gallery support added to both platforms

**Status**: Ready for production deployment! ðŸš€
